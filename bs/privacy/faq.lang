Stojimo u ljude iznad profita.


# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
Može biti neobično za ljude da znaju šta očekivati od bilo kojeg softvera ili usluga koje koriste danas. Tehnologija koja pokreće naše živote je kompleksna i ljudi nemaju vremena da je istraže u detalje. To je još uvijek istinito za Firefox, gdje smatramo da ljudi imaju mnogo različitih ideja o tome šta se dešava pod okriljem njihovog browsera.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
Slijedimo niz <a href="%(link)s">Načela privatnosti podataka</a> koji oblikuju naš prustup privatnosti u Firefox desktop i mobilnim browserima.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
Mi samo prikupljamo podatke koje trebamo za pravljenje najboljih proizvoda.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
Stavljamo ljude u kontrolu njihovih podataka i online iskustava.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
Pratimo princip “bez iznenađenja”, što znači da radimo naporno kako bismo bili sigurni da je razumjevanje Firefox korisnika što bliže stvarnosti.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
Sljedeća pitanja i odgovori bi trebali da vam pomognu razumjeti šta očekivati od Mozille i Firefoxa:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Koristim Firefox za gotovo sve na webu. Vi u Mozilli mora da znate gomilu stvari o meni, jel' da?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, web browser koji radi na vašem uređaju ili kompjuteru, je vaš put do interneta. Vaš browser će upravljati sa dosta informacija o web stranicama koje posjetite, ali te informacije ostaju na vašem uređaju. Mozilla, kompanija koja pravi Firefox, ne prikuplja ih (osim ako to ne tražite).


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
Stvarno, ne prikupljate moju historiju pretraživanja?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.
Mozilla ne zna toliko puno kako vi očekujete o tome kako ljudi pretražuju web. Kao graditelji browsera, to je ustvari veliki izazov za nas. Zato mi ugrađujemo opcione alate, kao što je <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, koji dozvoljavaju korisnicima da nam daju pristup njihovom web pretraživanju. Ako sinrhonizujete vašu historiju pretraživanja putem Firefox instalacija, mi ne znamo šta je ta historija - jer je šifrovana od strane vašeg uređaja.


;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
Izgleda kao da svaka kompanija na webu kupuje i prodaje moje podatke. Vi vjerovatno niste drugačiji.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
Mozilla ne prodaje podatke o vama i ne kupujemo podatke o vama.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
Čekaj, kako onda vi zarađujete novac?

;The first is what we call "technical data." This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
