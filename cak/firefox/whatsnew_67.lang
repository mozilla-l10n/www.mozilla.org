# "More power to you" is an American English idiom wishing someone success in their endeavors, and here is also a play on words saying Firefox gives users more power and control over their web experience. A more literal alternative would be "You have more power with every update"

Mas awuchuq'a' rik'in ri jujun k'exoj

# "upped" means increased or improved
