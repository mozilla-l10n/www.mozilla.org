;Lightbeam for Firefox
Lightbeam για τον Firefox


;Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.
Το Lightbeam είναι ένα πρόσθετο του Firefox που χρησιμοποιεί διαδραστικές απεικονίσεις για να εμφανίσει τους ιστότοπους με τους οποίους έρχεστε σε επαφή άμεσα και έμμεσα στον ιστό.


;Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You
Ρίξτε φως σ' αυτούς που σας παρακολουθούν


;See who’s tracking you online
Δείτε ποιοι καταγράφουν τη συμπεριφορά σας στο διαδίκτυο


;As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.
Το Lightbeam αποκαλύπτει το πλήρες βάθος του ιστού σήμερα καθώς εσείς περιηγείστε, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των τμημάτων του που δεν είναι ορατά από τον μέσο χρήστη.

;How Lightbeam Works
Πως λειτουργεί το Lightbeam


;Download and run the Lightbeam add-on in your Firefox browser.
Κάντε λήψη και εκτελέστε το πρόσθετο Lightbeam στον περιηγητή Firefox.


;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
Το Lightbeam θα δημιουργήσει ένα αρχείο συμβάντων για κάθε ιστότοπο που επισκέπτεστε και κάθε ιστότοπο τρίτων, το οποίο θα αποθηκευτεί στον περιηγητή σας.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Το Lightbeam απεικονίζει γραφήματα βασισμένα σ' αυτά τα συμβάντα για να επισημάνει την αλληλεπίδραση μεταξύ των ιστότοπων που επισκέπτεστε με ιστότοπους τρίτων.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.
Το Lightbeam θα συνεχίσει να προσθέτει γραφήματα καθώς εσείς συνεχίζετε την περιήγηση σας. Μπορείτε να το σταματήσετε οποιαδήποτε στιγμή απενεργοποιώντας ή απεγκαθιστώντας το πρόσθετο. Τα δεδομένα του Lightbeam μπορούν να αποθηκευτούν ή να διαγραφούν εύκολα.


;Tracking & privacy
Καταγραφή συμπεριφοράς & ιδιωτικό απόρρητο


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.
Η καταγραφή συμπεριφοράς δεν είναι απαραίτητα κακή. Πολλές υπηρεσίες βασίζονται σε δεδομένα από τους χρήστες τους για να σας παρέχουν στοχευμένο περιεχόμενο και να βελτιώσουν την εμπειρία σας στο διαδίκτυο.


;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.
Η καταγραφή της συμπεριφοράς όμως, μπορεί να γίνει και εν αγνοία σας.


;That’s not okay for some.
Αυτό είναι απαράδεκτο για κάποιους.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.
Εσείς θα πρέπει να είστε αυτοί που αποφασίζετε πότε, πως και αν επιθυμείτε να διαμοιράζονται τα δεδομένα της περιήγησης σας. Αναγνωρίζουμε πόσο σημαντική είναι η διαφάνεια σ' αυτό το θέμα και θεωρούμε αποστολή μας να δώσουμε τον έλεγχο στους χρήστες - παρέχοντας τους τόσο τα εργαλεία, όσο και την ενημέρωση.


;Explore the database
Εξερευνήστε τη βάση δεδομένων


;In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by donors who use the Lightbeam add-on.
Στη βάση δεδομένων του Lightbeam, θα έχετε τη δυνατότητα να δείτε το πως συνδέονται διάφοροι ιστότοποι με ιστοτόπους τρίτων, με βάση δεδομένα που γίνονται δωρεά από χρήστες του πρόσθετου Lightbeam.


;We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.
