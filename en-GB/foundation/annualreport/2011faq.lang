;How do you measure success?
How do you measure success?


;At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers. We succeed when we build products that people love, and when other organizations build build the traits and features we care about into competing products. For example, we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission.

When we see growth in community contributors, software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for example, we know we are moving toward our goals and we are seeing growth in these areas.

;<a href="%(collusion_url)s" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">Mozilla Collusion</a> gives consumers a powerful tool to protect their privacy, arming them with transparency, facts and the power to make their own decisions about how their personal data is shared and used. Made possible with the support of the Ford Foundation, Collusion allows users to see who is tracking them across the Web. It shows, in real time, how that data creates a spider-web of interaction between companies and other trackers.

;The majority of our revenue comes from the search functionality in the Firefox browser. Google is the largest source of revenue and in December 2011, we announced that we negotiated a significant and mutually beneficial revenue agreement with Google. This new agreement extends our long term search relationship with Google for at least three additional years.

;Mozilla was one of many organizations that blacked out its websites in opposition to the SOPA/PIPA bills in congress. For the first time, the Web community of more than 15 million people came together to speak against a policy that affected the Web as a whole. This historic protest represented a significant turning point for the Web as a way to engage the electorate and mobilize citizens for change.

;Firefox will always be the part of the Mozilla mission that people can see, feel and touch. We are excited by the progress and innovation we have seen with the desktop version of Firefox over the past year. Several performance and security improvements, memory enhancements make this the best Firefox yet. We're proud of the work that we're doing to make developing on Firefox easier by adding exciting tools for developers, like <a href="%(cmdline_url)s" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">Developer Command Line</a>, <a href="%(console_url)s" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">Web Console</a> and <a href="%(tilt_url)s" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">“Tilt” the 3D Page Inspector</a>.

;Mozilla is an organization that is fundamentally about people and making the Web better for everyone. The Mozilla community is essential to the success of the project. We can’t fight for an open, hackable and transparent Web without people who believe in and support that cause. We have Mozilla communities spanning the world and these remarkable people are responsible for coding, testing, localizing, hosting hackfests and summer code parties, teaching Webmakers, marketing, evangelizing Mozilla products and much more.

;Mozilla is proudly non-profit and answers to no one but you. That means we're uniquely able to fight for users at a critical moment in the Web's history. Looking forward, we will mobilize millions of people to stand up for privacy, security and online freedom. We will take on new threats to the Web's future — from locked down proprietary platforms, to would-be censors and gatekeepers, to short-sighted government legislation. Together we will set the mobile Web free, reassert the vital importance of privacy and user sovereignty, and join others in building a more Web-literate world.

;In June 2012 we released an update to <a href="%(mobile_url)s" rel="external">Firefox for Android</a> that we believe is the best browser for Android available. We completely rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI, resulting in a snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly faster than the Android stock browser. This made Firefox significantly faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser. We also added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their intent for privacy, even on mobile and are the first mobile browser to offer Do Not Track. Firefox for Android is a critical part of supporting the open Web. This is a great start, but it is only a start. We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience.
