Thanks for your interest in getting involved with Mozilla.

Visual design is handled by our Creative team and we work on projects ranging
from logos to marketing campaigns to websites to... well, just about anything
and everything visual around here. If that sounds like something you'd like to
be a part of, here are some next steps you can take:

o Follow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/mozcreative -- We might post
design work here as well, but we mostly use this as an information channel for
topics related to Mozilla and design in general, including things we like and
that inspire us.

o Learn more on the wiki: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Design? -- Find out about the
kinds of projects you can contribute to as well as links to other resources.
We'll update it periodically, so please check back often.

If you have questions or comments about any of this, please feel free to write
back.

-- The Creative Team
