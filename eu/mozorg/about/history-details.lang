;The future is full of challenges and opportunities equal to those of our past.
Etorkizuna erronkaz eta aukeraz betea dator, iraganean ere izan zen bezala.


;There’s no guarantee that the Internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe.
Ez dago bermatzerik Internetek irekia, gozagarria edo segurua izaten jarraituko duenik.


;Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people to make their voices heard and to shape their own online lives.
Mozillak aukera bat eskaintzen jarraituko du jendearen ahotsa entzun dadin, eta haien lineako bizitzen gaineko kontrola izan dezaten.


;Of course, we’re not alone in doing this.
Jakina, ez gaude bakarrik zeregin honetan.


;The Mozilla community, together with other open source projects and other public benefit organizations, exists only because of the people who are engaged in making our common goals a reality.
Mozilla komunitatea existitzen bada, iturburu irekiko beste proiektu eta onura publikoko beste erakunde batzuekin batera, gure helburu komunak errealitate bilakatzeko konpromisoa hartu duten pertsonei esker da.
