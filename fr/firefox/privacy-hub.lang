# An alternate translation for this could be "Firefox takes less data, keeps it safe, and doesn’t keep secrets".
;Firefox takes less data, keeps it safe, and with no secrets.
Firefox recueille moins de données, les protège, et ne vous cache rien.


;Firefox products are designed to protect your <strong>privacy</strong>
Les produits Firefox sont conçus pour protéger votre <strong>vie privée</strong>


;You should be able to decide who sees your personal info. Not just among your friends, but with every advertiser and company on the internet — including us.
Vous devez pouvoir décider vous-même avec qui vous voulez partager vos informations personnelles. Pas seulement avec vos amis, mais également avec les annonceurs publicitaires et les entreprises en ligne, y compris la nôtre.


;That’s why everything we make and do honors our Personal Data Promise
C'est pour cette raison que nous respectons notre engagement concernant les données personnelles dans tout ce que nous entreprenons


;Take Less
Moins d'informations


;We make a point of knowing less about you
Nous mettons un point d'honneur à en savoir le moins sur vous que possible


;All tech companies collect data to improve their products. But it doesn’t need to include so much of your personal info. The only data we want is the data that serves you in the end. We ask ourselves: do we actually need this? What do we need it for? And when can we delete it?
Toutes les entreprises en ligne recueillent des données afin d'améliorer leurs services. Mais elles n'ont pas besoin de recueillir autant d'informations personnelles vous concernant. Les seules données que nous nécessitons sont celles qui finiront par vous servir. Nous nous posons toujours les questions suivantes : avons-nous vraiment besoin de ces données ? À quoi serviront-elles ? Quand pourrons-nous les supprimer ?


;Keep it safe
Plus de protection


;We do the hard work to protect your personal info
C'est nous qui faisons le travail pour protéger vos données personnelles


;Data security is complicated — or at least it should be. Which is why we take the extra steps to classify the data we have, maintain rules for how we store and protect each type, and never stop iterating on our processes. We prioritize your privacy. We invest in it. We’re committed to it. We even teach other companies how to do it.
Sécuriser les données est une affaire complexe, et cela doit le rester. C'est pour cette raison que nous prenons toutes les mesures nécessaires pour classifier les données dont nous disposons et conformer à des règles strictes concernant leur stockage. C'est un processus que nous améliorons sans cesse. Le respect de votre vie privée est notre priorité. C'est un véritable engagement. C'est ce en quoi nous croyons et investissons nos efforts. Nous formons même d'autres entreprises. Notre engagement est si fort que nous formons d'autres entreprises dans le domaine.


;No secrets
Pas de secrets


;You’ll always know where you stand with us
Nous sommes toujours transparents
