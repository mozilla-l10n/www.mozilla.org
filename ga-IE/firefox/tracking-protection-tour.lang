;How Tracking Protection works
Conas a oibríonn Cosaint ar Lorgaireacht


;When you see the shield, Firefox is blocking some parts of the page that could track your browsing activity.
Nuair a fheiceann tú an sciath, tá Firefox ag cur bac ar chodanna den leathanach a d'fhéadfadh lorgaireacht a dhéanamh ar do ghníomhaíocht bhrabhsála.
