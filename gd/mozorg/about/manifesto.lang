# Strings for mozilla.org/about/manifesto/details/
;Introduction
Ro-ràdh


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
Tha an t-eadar-lìon a’ sìor-fhàs nas cudromaiche ’nar beatha.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Tha pròiseact Mozilla 'na choimhearsnachd eadar-nàiseanta de dhaoine a tha dhen bheachd gu bheil slàinte an lìn a' crochadh air fosgailteachd, tionnsgnadh is cothroman. Tha sinn air a bhith a' co-obrachadh a-mach o 1998 gus dèanamh cinnteach gu bheil an t-eadar-lìon 'ga leasachadh air dòigh a bhios feumail dhan a h-uile duine. Am measg nan rudan a chruthaich sinn, 's e am brabhsair-lìn Firefox am fear as ainmeil gu ruige seo.


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Tha pròiseact Mozilla ag obair leis a' choimhearsnachd gus sàr bhathar-bog le còd fosgailte a chruthachadh agus airson dòighean ùr a lorg gus co-obrachadh a dhèanamh. Cruthaichidh sinn coimhearsnachdan de dhaoine a tha iad uile ag obair airson piseach a chur air an eadar-lìon a chum leas chàich.


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
Ri linn ar saothrach, stèidhich sinn grunn phrionnsabalan a tha aig cridhe an eadar-lìn 'nar beachd-ne airson 's gum bi e an dà chuid a chum math nan daoine is math saoghal a' ghnothachais. Chithear na prionnsabalan seo gu h-ìosal.


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
Seo ar n-amasan a-rèir a' mhanifesto:


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
dealbh a dhèanamh dhen lèirsinn dhan eadar-lìon a bu chòir do dh'Fhonndas Mozilla amas air a-rèir coimhearsnachd Mozilla;


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
bruidhinn ri daoine ge be dè na sgilean teicnigeach a tha aca;


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
com-pàirtichean Mozilla a dhèanamh pròiseil às na tha sinn a' dèanamh 's brosnachadh a thoirt dhaibh a leantainn orra leis an deagh-obair; agus


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
ùrlar a thoirt do dhaoine eile air an leasaich iad an lèirsinn seo dhen eadar-lìon.


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Chan ann às an adhar a thàinig na prionnsabalan seo. Tha feum air daoine gus an lìon a chumail fosgailte agus 'na àite far an urrainn dhan a h-uile duine pàirt a ghabhail - daoine a nì rudan air an ceann fhèin, feadhainn a cho-obraicheas ann am buidhnean no ceannardan. Tha Fonndas Mozilla an dealas ri brosnachadh nam prionnsabalan a tha ann am manifesto Mozilla. Tha sinn a' toirt cuireadh dhan a h-uile duine àite fiù nas fhearr a dhèanamh dhen eadar-lìon.


;Principles
Na prionnsabalan


;Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
Feumaidh comas a bhith ag daoine an t-eadar-lìon a dhealbhadh agus na nì iad air.


;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Adhartachadh manifesto Mozilla


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Tha diofar dòighean ann air an gabh prionnsabalan manifesto Mozilla adhartachadh. Tha sinn a' cur fàilte air raon farsaing dhe ghnìomhachdan agus tha sinn an dùil gum faic sinn an aon spiorad cruthachail a tha air a bhith follaiseach ann an gnìomhachdan eile na h-iomairt. Mur eil cuideigin airson a bhith an sàs ann gu domhain, tha dòigh shimplidh èifeachdach ann gus taic a chumail ris a' mhanifesto - a' cur gu feum Firefox is bathar eile sa bheil prionnsabalan a' mhanifesto.


;Mozilla Foundation Pledge
Geall Fonndas Mozilla


;The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:

cleachdaidh sinn maoin Mozilla (seilbh inntleachdail mar chòraichean-lethbhreac is comharran-malairt, bun-structar, maoin is cliù) gus an t-eadar-lìon a chumail fosgailte;


;promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; and

;Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
Tha cuid de ghnìomhachdan an fhonndais — cruthachadh, lìbhrigeadh is brosnachadh bathar luchd-cleachdaidh aig an àm seo — 'ga choileanadh slighe Corporaid Mozilla, an fho-chuideachd a tha gu tur ann an seilbh Fhonndas Mozilla.


;Invitation
Cuireadh


;The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.
Tha Fonndas Mozilla a' toirt cuireadh do chàch (a bheir taic do phrionnsabalan manifesto Mozilla) pàirt a ghabhail ann gus dòighean ùra a lorg lèirsinn an eadar-lìn a thoirt am bith.
