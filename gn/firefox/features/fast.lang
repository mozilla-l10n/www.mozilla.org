;Firefox is now faster and leaner
Ko’ág̃a Firefox ipya’eve


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Romba’apo hína eipuru porãve hag̃ua nde aravo.


;Use less memory
Oipuru sa’ive mandu’arenda


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
¡Avave ndoipotái peteĩ kundaha ikarúva! Firefox ha’e kundaha ojapóva tekotevẽkuete. Oipuru sa’ivégui RAM Chrome-gui, ambue ne rembiaporape ikatu omba'apo gueteri pya’eterei.


;Get all the tabs without lags
Eguereko tendayke pya’e


;Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
