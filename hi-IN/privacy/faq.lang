# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
लोगों के लिए यह जानना मुश्किल है कि किसी भी सॉफ्टवेयर या सर्विस जिन्हें वो आज इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं उनसे कैसी उम्मीद राखी जाए। हमारे जीवन में जो टेक्नोलॉजी शक्ति प्रदान कर रही है वो काफी जटिल है और लोगों के पास इसे विस्तृत रूप से जानने का समय नहीं है। जो कि Firefox के लिए अब भी सच है, जहाँ हम पाते हैं कि लोगों के पास काफी अलग-अलग विचार हैं की उनके ब्राउज़र में पीछे क्या चलता रहता है।

;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
हम केवल सर्वश्रेष्ठ प्रोडक्ट बनाने के लिए जरुरी डेटा एकत्रित करते हैं।


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
हम लोगों को उनके डेटा और ऑनलाइन अनुभवों के नियंत्रण में रखते हैं।


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.

;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
Mozilla एवं Firefox से किस तरह कि उम्मीद रखी जाए इसे समझने में निम्न प्रश्नों एवं उत्तरों से आपको मदद मिलेगी:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
वेब पर लगभग सारी चीज़ें के लिए मैं FIrefox इस्तेमाल करता हूँ। आप Mozilla में रहने वाले मेरे बारे में जरुर काफी चीज़ें जानतें होंगे, है ना?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, वेब ब्राउज़र जो आपके उपकरण या कंप्यूटर पर चलता है, इंटरनेट तक पहुँचने के लिए आपका साधन है। आपका ब्राउज़र जिस वेबसाइट को आप देखते हैं उसकी काफी सारी जानकारियाँ संभालती है, पर वो जानकारियाँ आपके उपकरण पर ही रहती हैं। Mozilla, कंपनी जिसने Firefox को बनाया, वो इन्हें इकट्ठा नहीं करती (जब तक आप हमसे ऐसा करने को ना कहें)।


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
सचमुच, आप मेरे ब्राउज़िंग इतिहास को इकट्ठा नहीं करते?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
