;The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.

;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

# Strings for mozilla.org/about/manifesto/details/
;Introduction
Uvod


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
Internet postaje sve važniji dio naših života.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Mozilla projekt globalna je zajednica ljudi koji vjeruju da su otvorenost, inovativnost i prilagodljivost ključni za očuvanje Interneta. Zajedno radimo od 1998., nastojeći osigurati razvoj Interneta na način koji koristi svakome. Najpoznatiji smo kao kreatori Firefox web preglednika.


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Mozilla projekt koristi pristup zasnovan na zajednici kako bi kreirali svjetski priznat softver otvorenog koda i razvili nove načine suradnje. Okupljamo zajednicu ljudi posvećenih stvaranju boljeg iskustva korištenja Interneta za sve nas.


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
Kao rezultat tih nastojanja stvoren je skup pravila, načela za koje vjerujemo da su ključni kako bi Internet nastavio služiti kako javnim interesima, tako i komercijalnim aspektima života. Ta načela navodimo u nastavku dokumenta.


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
Ciljevi Manifesta su:


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
odrediti jasnu viziju Interneta prema kojoj sudionici Mozille žele da Mozilla Fundacija postupa;


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
biti jasan ljudima bez obzira na njihovo tehničko predznanje


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
učiniti doprinositelje Mozilla projekta ponosnima na ono što rade i motivirati ih na daljnji rad; te


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
dati okvir za promicanje ove vizije Interneta


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Ti se ciljevi neće ostvariti sami po sebi. Ljudi su ti koji Internet trebaju napraviti otvorenim i spremnim na suradnju - bilo da djeluju individualno, radeći u grupama ili vodeći druge. Mozilla Fundacija posvećena je provođenju načela navedenih u Mozilla Manifestu. Pozivamo ostale da nam se pridruže u nastojanju da Internet učinimo boljim mjestom za svakoga.


;Principles
NAČELA


;Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
Pojedinci moraju imati mogućnosti oblikovanja Interneta i svojih vlastitih iskustava na Internetu.


;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
PROMICANJE MOZILLA MANIFESTA


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Postoji mnogo načina promicanja Mozilla manifesta. Podržavamo širok raspon aktivnosti i očekujemo istu razinu kreativnosti koju Mozilla doprinositelji pokazuju u drugim aktivnostima Projekta. Za ljude koji ne sudjeluju aktivno u radu Mozilla projekta, osnovan, no vrlo učinkovit način podržavanja Manifesta je korištenje Mozilla Firefoxa i ostalih proizvoda koji utjelovljuju načela Manifesta.


;Mozilla Foundation Pledge
Zavjet Mozilla Fundacije


;The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:
Mozilla Fundacija se obvezuje da će podržati načela izložena u Mozilla Manifestu. Konkretno, mi ćemo:


;build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto’s principles;
stvarati i podržavati tehnologije otvorenog koda i zajednice koje se pridržavaju načela iznesenim u Manifestu;


;build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s principles;
stvarati i činiti dostupnima proizvode koji podržavaju načela iznesena u Manifestu;


;use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the Internet an open platform;
koristiti Mozilline resurse (intelektualno vlasništvo kao što su autorska prava i zaštićeni trgovački znakovi, infrastrukturu, financijske resurse i ugled) kako bi Internet ostao otvorena platforma;


;promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; and
promovirati modele za stvaranje ekonomskih vrijednosti za opće dobro; te


;promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry.
promovirati načela iznesena u Manifestu u javnim raspravama i unutar samog gospodarstva Interneta.


;Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
Neke djelatnosti Fundacije - u ovom trenutku stvaranje, isporuka i promocija proizvoda - vrše se primarno kroz podružnicu u potpunom vlasništvu Mozilla Fundacije, tvrtku Mozilla Corporation.


;Invitation
Poziv


;The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.
Mozilla Fundacija poziva sve koji podržavaju načela iznesena u Mozilla Manifestu da nam se pridruže, te nam pomognu u pronalasku novih načina pretakanja ove vizije Interneta u stvarnost.
