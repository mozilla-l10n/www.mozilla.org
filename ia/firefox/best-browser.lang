# HTML page description
;So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
Tante optiones de navigator web, ma solo uno il ha, que functiona melio pro tu besonios. Le melior navigator pro te deberea offerer ambe: velocitate e protection del confidentialitate.


;Privacy, speed, and security.
Confidentialitate, velocitate, e securitate.


;How to choose the best browser for you.
Como seliger le melior navigator pro te.


;The internet has become as essential as electricity and running water, so choosing the best browser for you is more important than ever. The internet is a second office, a teacher and sometimes a medical advisor, even if your actual doctor would prefer you didn’t look up your symptoms online.
Internet ha devenite assi essential como electricitate e aqua fluente, assi le selection del melior navigator pro te es plus importante que mais. Internet es un secunde officio, un inseniante e aliquando un consultor medic, mesmo si tu actual doctor prefererea que tu non cerca tu symptomas online.


;In the mid-nineties, Netscape, Internet Explorer and AOL dominated the landscape. It was a simpler time when the sweet melody of dial-up internet rang across the land. You learned the meaning of patience waiting for web pages to load. Back then, all that mattered was browser speed.
In le medie-novanta, Netscape, Internet Explorer e AOL dominava le paisage. Era un tempore plus simple, quando le dulce melodia del composition del modem resonava per le terra. Tu apprendeva le acception de patientia attendente le cargamentos del paginas web. Alora, tote lo que importava era le velocitate del navigator.


;Today is a different story. Ads, privacy hacks, security breaches, and fake news might have you looking at other qualities in a browser. How does the browser protect your privacy? Does it allow trackers to follow you across the web? Does it built to multitask and handle many computer and internet operations at once?
Hodie es un historia differente. Avisos publicitari, hachamentos de confidentialitate, violationes de securitate e false novas, pote exiger que tu cerca altere qualitates in un navigator. Como le navigator protege tu confidentialitate? Permitte illo que traciatores te seque tra le web? Es illo facite pro multitask e pro gerer contemporaneemente plure operationes de computator e internet?


;When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
Le navigator es de uso general, assi illo debe esser veloce, ma anque reservate. Illo accede a toto lo que tu face in rete, assi si illo non ha forte functionalitates de confidentialitate, te pone a riscos real.

;If you’re wondering what it means to have a private or fast browser, here’s a breakdown of three things a browser should have.
Si tu ha curiositate re que significa haber un navigator reservate o rapide, ecce un evidentia de tres cosas que illo deberea haber.


;A browser built for speed.
Un navigator construite pro velocitate.


;A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.

;This is one of the many reasons to choose the Firefox browser: Firefox blocks third-party trackers by default. We have other reasons and we’ll get into those later.

;Remember the last massive data breach? If not, it’s probably because it happens so often. Companies hold on to customer data, like their personal or financial information, and hackers steal it. If you’re making safety a priority, then a secure internet browser is the best browser for you.

;There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.

;The second is not storing too much user data. Hackers can’t steal what’s not there, which is why Firefox keeps a minimum amount of information about its users. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox knows</a> if you use the browser and your general location <a href="%(privacy)s">but not the name of your childhood pet or your favorite color.</a>

;Last but not least, a safe browser should offer tools to help you keep an eye on your accounts. Think of alerts that go straight to your email if any of your accounts get breached or icons that tell you whether a website is encrypted, (i.e., if it’s a good idea to enter your credit number on a shopping site).

;Firefox is offering something new to keep you safe: <a href="%(monitor)s">Firefox Monitor</a>. It’s a free service that will alert you if there are any public hacks on your accounts and let you know if your accounts got hacked in the past. Another neat feature is the Green Lock. It looks like a small green icon at the top left side of the browser window. If you’re on Firefox and see the green lock, it means the website is encrypted and secure. If the lock is grey, you might want to think twice about entering any sensitive information.

;We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.

;Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

;Trackers are all those annoying “cookies” messages you get on airline sites. These third-party trackers know where you click and can be used to analyze your behavior. A private browser should give users the option to turn off third-party trackers, but ideally, turn them off by default.

;Another way to stop trackers from tracking is using private mode to browse. Any browser that claims to be private should offer browsing in private mode.
