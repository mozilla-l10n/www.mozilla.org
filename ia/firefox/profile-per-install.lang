;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Un importante cambiamento in Firefox: le profilos dedicate


;What’s Changed
Lo que es cambiate


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.

;How Dedicated Profiles Work

;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.

;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.
Le installation que tu elige como tu installation de Firefox primari retenera tu datos de profilo previemente compartite como: marcapaginas, chronologia e contrasignos.


;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.
