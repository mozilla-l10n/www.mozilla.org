;A healthy Internet is open for innovation
Un internet salubre es aperte al innovation


;The Internet was built on the promise that any one of us might create the next big thing. But in order to keep creating, imagining, and reinventing our future online, the building blocks of the Web must be open to all. And together, we need to make sure the policies and laws that govern those building blocks are fair and functional.
Internet esseva construite con le promissa que qualcunque del nos potera crear le proxime grande cosa. Ma pro mantener crear, imaginar, e reinventar nostre futuro online, le blocos constructive del web debe ser aperte a totes. E insimul, nos debe verificar que le politicas e le leges que governa ille blocos constructive es eque e functional.

;Open source software – technology built with code that is open for view, use, and modification – is the engine that powers a huge amount of the Internet, from servers to operating systems to the bots that fetch your search results. It’s the infrastructure that makes the Web a truly public resource: transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative, so that anyone with an idea can contribute. But much like our IRL infrastructure, we have to commit the attention and resources to maintain it.
Software open-source – technologia construite con codice que es aperte al vider, usar e modificar – es le motor que potentia un enorme quantitate de internet, ab le servitores de systemas operative al robots que reporta tu resultatos del recerca.

Ma justo como in nostre infrastructura del vita real, nos debe committer le attention e le ressources pro mantener illo.

;Patents were designed to create incentive for innovation. But the patent system and software development don’t always get along so well. Software patents are often written so broadly that they’re open to misinterpretation, and exclusive rights can far outlive the shelf life of the software itself. All of which creates obstacles and uncertainty for innovators, and leaves the door open for patent trolls and endless litigation.
