;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Perubahan Penting di Firefox: Profil Khusus


;What’s Changed
Apa yang Berubah


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
Sebelumnya, semua pemasangan Firefox berbagi profil tunggal secara bawaan. Sekarang, Firefox menyediakan profil khusus untuk tiap-tiap pemasangan Firefox (termasuk pemasangan Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, atau Firefox ESR). Hal ini menjadikan Firefox lebih stabil ketika beralih antara pemasangan Firefox pada komputer yang sama.


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
Cara Kerja Profil Khusus


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox menyimpan informasi seperti markah, sandi, dan preferensi pengguna dalam seperangkat berkas bernama profil Anda. Profil ini disimpan di lokasi yang terpisah dari berkas program Firefox.


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.

;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.
