Hi,
we're glad to hear from you! Feel free to have a look at http://whatcanidoformozilla.org if you're interested in joining a particular project or team. Meanwhile, here are some general opportunities for writing code for Firefox.

To get started with the codebase, have a look at http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Introduction.

If you need any help, you can obtain it on IRC. I recommend visiting #introduction, which is specifically for newcomers. Visit http://irc.mozilla.org for information on how to access it.

Happy hacking!
