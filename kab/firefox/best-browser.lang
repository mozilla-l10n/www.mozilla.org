# HTML page description
;So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
Llan ddeqs n yiminigen, maca ala yiwen i ilaqen i sekra n wayen teḥwaǧeḍ. Iminig-ik ufrin yessefk ad yili d arurad, daɣen ad yeḍmen aqadeṛ n tudert tabaḍnit.


;Privacy, speed, and security.
Tabaḍnit, arrured akked tɣellist.


;How to choose the best browser for you.
Amek ara tferneḍ iminig ufrin.


;The internet has become as essential as electricity and running water, so choosing the best browser for you is more important than ever. The internet is a second office, a teacher and sometimes a medical advisor, even if your actual doctor would prefer you didn’t look up your symptoms online.
Internet yuɣal d taɣawsa ilaqen yal ass am trisiti d waman, ihi afran n yiminig ifazen daɣen d tamsalt meqqren urǧin tella ar ass-a. Internet tuɣal d tanarit, d tiliẓri, d aselmad, daɣen tikwal d amejjay, xas wama amejjay-ik n tidet ad yebɣu axiṛ ad tɛeddiḍ ɣur-s tikwal akken ad k-iwali wala tujjya srid.


;In the mid-nineties, Netscape, Internet Explorer and AOL dominated the landscape. It was a simpler time when the sweet melody of dial-up internet rang across the land. You learned the meaning of patience waiting for web pages to load. Back then, all that mattered was browser speed.
Deg tlemmast n yiseggasen n ttɛin, Netscape, Internet Explorer d AOL ṭɣan ɣef Web. Anwa ur d-nemmekti ara aẓawan n umudim ticki iteqqen ɣer Internet. Tlemdeḍ ssbeṛ i ilaqen akken ad d-yali usebter. Di tallit-nni, nettwali kan arured n yiminig.


;Today is a different story. Ads, privacy hacks, security breaches, and fake news might have you looking at other qualities in a browser. How does the browser protect your privacy? Does it allow trackers to follow you across the web? Does it built to multitask and handle many computer and internet operations at once?
Ass-a, d taqsiḍt-nniḍen. Gar udellel imezgi, tarewla n yisefka akked yisallen n ukellex, mačči d ayen yessewhamen imi wid yettinigen deg Internet suturen ugar seg yiminig. Amek iminig ad immesten isefka-nsen? Ad yeǧǧ ineḍfaṛen ad k-ḍefṛen deg yal amḍiq deg web? Yettwafeṣṣel akken yeg dddeqs n ccɣel i tikkelt?


;When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
Tseqdaceḍ iminig deg yal amḍiq. Ilaq ihi ad yili d arurad. Maca daɣen ilaq ad iqadeṛ isefka-ik udmawanen. Iminig ikeččem ɣer wayen akk iɣer i trezzuḍ srid, daɣen yezmer ad k-yerr deg yir taswiɛt ma yella ur yesɛi ara iɣewwaṛen n tɣellist leqqayen.

;If you’re wondering what it means to have a private or fast browser, here’s a breakdown of three things a browser should have.
Ma tebɣiḍ ad tezreḍ d acu i d anamek n yiming arurd daɣen d abadni, a-ten-an kraḍ n yiferdisen ara tawiḍ deg ufran-ik.


;A browser built for speed.
Iminig ifeṣṣlen akken ad yili d arurad.


;A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.
Iminig d afecku, daɣen am yal afecku, yelha lemmer ad nissin ad nefren win i ilaqen i twuri-is. Ma d amdan yesran axeddim akken ad tawiḍ ayen teḥwaǧeḍ, ilaq-ak yiminig arurad, d ayen fessusen nezzeh. Iminig i yesseqdacen ineḍfaṛen izmer ad yeglu s tazayt. Ineḍfaṛen d inagan n tuqqna i iteddun deg ugilal n usmel, yessaẓay daɣen tunigin. Skud iminig yessewḥal ineḍfaṛen, skud iteddu s zreb.


;This is one of the many reasons to choose the Firefox browser: Firefox blocks third-party trackers by default. We have other reasons and we’ll get into those later.
D yiwet seg ddeqs n sebbat fiɣer i ilaq ad nefren Firefox: D tidet, Firefox yessewḥal ineḍfaṛen s wudem amezwer. Llant ddeqs n sebbat-nniḍen uɣur ad d-nuɣal ɣer zdat.


;A browser that puts safety first.
Iminig yettarran taɣellist i d tamezwarut.


;Remember the last massive data breach? If not, it’s probably because it happens so often. Companies hold on to customer data, like their personal or financial information, and hackers steal it. If you’re making safety a priority, then a secure internet browser is the best browser for you.
Tecfiḍ ɣef trewla n yisefka taneggarut? Ahat ala, acku aya iḍerru-d acḥal n tikkal. Tikebbaniyin ceffunt ɣef yisefka n yimsaɣen-nsent, am telɣut tudmawant akked tin n tedrimt i ttakren imakaren. Ma yella taɣellist d ayen i k-iceɣben, iminig aɣelsan d win yellan d ufrin i kečč.


;There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.
Iminig yezmer ad immesten iseqdacen-is s ddeqs n tarrayin. Di tazwara, iminig s lqem aneggaru n t qellist izmer ad immesten aselkim-ik akked yismal mgal yir tirziwin n yivirusen akked yir iseɣzanen.


;The second is not storing too much user data. Hackers can’t steal what’s not there, which is why Firefox keeps a minimum amount of information about its users. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox knows</a> if you use the browser and your general location <a href="%(privacy)s">but not the name of your childhood pet or your favorite color.</a>
Tis snat, ur ilaq ara ad teskelseḍ ddeqs n yisefka n useqdac. D tidet, imakaren ur zmiren ara ad akren ayen ur nelli ara, ɣef aya Firefox ijemmeɛ kan kra n telɣut ɣef yiseqdacen. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox yeẓra</a> ticki tesseqdaceḍ iminig daɣen yeẓra anida telliḍ <a href="%(privacy)s">maca ur yessin ara isem n uɣersiw-ik n uxxam neɣ ini i tḥemmled.</a>


;Last but not least, a safe browser should offer tools to help you keep an eye on your accounts. Think of alerts that go straight to your email if any of your accounts get breached or icons that tell you whether a website is encrypted, (i.e., if it’s a good idea to enter your credit number on a shopping site).
Ɣer taggar, iminig aɣelsan yessefk ad d-imudd ifecka ara k-yeǧǧen ad ɛasseḍ imiḍanen-ik. Amedya, ilɣa s yimayl ma yella yiwen seg yimiḍanen-ik tḥuza-t trewla n yisefka, neɣ daɣen ipiktugṛamen i d-yemmalen d akken asmel d awgelhan ( aya yebɣa ad d-yini d akken tzemreḍ ad teskecmeḍ takarḍa n lbanka deg usmel n uzenzi s wudem aɣelsan).


;Firefox is offering something new to keep you safe: <a href="%(monitor)s">Firefox Monitor</a>. It’s a free service that will alert you if there are any public hacks on your accounts and let you know if your accounts got hacked in the past. Another neat feature is the Green Lock. It looks like a small green icon at the top left side of the browser window. If you’re on Firefox and see the green lock, it means the website is encrypted and secure. If the lock is grey, you might want to think twice about entering any sensitive information.

;We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.

;Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

;Trackers are all those annoying “cookies” messages you get on airline sites. These third-party trackers know where you click and can be used to analyze your behavior. A private browser should give users the option to turn off third-party trackers, but ideally, turn them off by default.

;Another way to stop trackers from tracking is using private mode to browse. Any browser that claims to be private should offer browsing in private mode.

;One easy way to check is to visit a browser’s content setting page and privacy policy. The privacy webpage should outline if your data is shared and why. It’s why the <a href="%(privacy)s">Firefox privacy notice</a> is easy to read and easy to find.
