;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
फायरफॉक्समध्ये महत्वाचा बदल: समर्पित प्रोफाइल


;What’s Changed
काय बदलले आहे


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.

;How Dedicated Profiles Work
समर्पित प्रोफाइल कसे कार्य करतात


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.

;All of your Firefox installations will now have separate profiles.
आपल्या सर्व Firefox प्रस्थापनांवरआता विभक्त प्रोफाइल असतील.


;What You Need to Do
आपल्याला काय करायचे आहे


;If you do nothing, each installation will have a separate profile. This means your profile data will be different on each installation of Firefox.
आपण काहीही न केल्यास, प्रत्येक स्थापनेचे वेगळे प्रोफाइल असेल. याचा अर्थ Firefox च्या प्रत्येक स्थापनेवर आपला प्रोफाइल डेटा भिन्न असेल.


;You can change which installation uses which profile using the profile manager. Directions on how to use the profile manager are available on <a href="%(support)s">this support page</a>.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.
