;History of the Mozilla Project
Historia bak Mozilla-prosjektet


;The Mozilla project was <a href="%(coderush)s">created in 1998</a> with the <a href="%(sourcerelease)s">release of the Netscape browser suite source code</a>.
Mozilla-prosjektet vart <a href="%(coderush)s">grunnlagt i 1998</a> i samband med <a href="%(sourcerelease)s">offentleggjeringa av kjeldekoden til nettlesaren Netscape suite</a>.


;It was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market.
Tanken var å utnytte den kreativa krafta hos alle dei tusentals av programmerarar på nettet, og inspirere til ei nyskaping utan sidestykke på nettlesarmarknaden.


;Within the <a href="%(firstyear)s">first year</a>, new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.
I løpet av <a href="%(firstyear)s">det første året</a> bidrog nye fellesskapsmedlemmar frå heile verda med nye funksjonar og forbetringar av eksisterande funksjonar, og engasjerte seg dessutan i forvaltninga og planlegginga av sjølve prosjektet.


;By creating an open community, the Mozilla project had become <a href="%(stevecase)s">larger than any one company</a>.
Ved å byggje ein open fellesskap hadde prosjektet Mozilla vorte <a href="%(stevecase)s">større enn enkelte selskap</a>.


;Community members got involved and expanded the scope of the project’s <a href="%(mission)s">original mission</a> — instead of just working on Netscape’s next browser, people started creating <a href="%(browsers)s">a variety of browsers</a>, <a href="%(bugzilla)s">development tools</a> and a range of other <a href="%(projects)s">projects</a>.

;People contributed to Mozilla in different ways, but everyone was passionate about creating free software that would enable people to have a choice in how they experienced the Internet.
Folk bidrog til Mozilla på ulike måtar, men alle brann for å skape fri og gratis programvare, som skulle gje folk mulegheita til å velje korleis dei ville oppleve og bruke nettet.


;After several years of development, <a href="%(mozilla1)s">Mozilla 1.0</a>, the first major version, was released in 2002. This version featured many improvements to the browser, email client and other applications included in the suite, but not many people were using it.

;By 2002, <a href="%(over90)s">well over 90%% of Internet users</a> were browsing with Internet Explorer.
I 2002 <a href="%(over90)s">brukte langt over 90 %% av alle internettbrukarane</a> nettlesaren Internet Explorer.


;Not many people noticed at the time, but the first version of Phoenix (later renamed to Firefox) was also released by Mozilla community members that year with the goal of providing the <a href="%(charter)s">best possible browsing experience</a> to the widest possible set of people.

;It did this by continuing to release software, such as Firefox and Thunderbird, and expanding to new areas, such as providing <a href="%(grants)s">grants</a> to support accessibility improvements on the Web.

;<a href="%(firefox1)s">Firefox 1.0</a> was released in 2004 and became a big success — in less than a year, it was downloaded <a href="%(millions)s">over 100 million times</a>.

Den fornya konkurransesituasjonen på marknaden har <a href="%(innovation)s">auka takta i nyskapinga</a> og forbetra nettet for alle.


;In 2013, we launched <a href="%(firefoxos)s">Firefox OS</a> to unleash the full power of the Web on smartphones and once again offer control and choice to a new generation of people coming online.
I 2013 lanserte vi <a href="%(firefoxos)s">Firefox OS</a> for at smarttelefoner skal kunne utnytte det fulle potensialet til nettet og tilby personleg kontroll og valfridom til ein ny generasjon på nettet.

;The community has shown that commercial companies can benefit by collaborating in open source projects and that great end user products can be produced as open source software.

;More people than ever before are using the Internet and are experiencing it <a href="%(all)s">in their own language</a>.
Fleire enn nokon gong tidlegare brukar nettet, og opplever det <a href="%(all)s">på sitt eige språk</a>.


;A sustainable organization has been created that uses market mechanisms to support a public benefit mission and this model has been reused by others to create open, transparent and collaborative organizations in a <a href="%(range)s">broad range</a> <a href="%(areas)s">of areas</a>.

;The future is full of challenges and opportunities equal to those of our past.
Framtida er like full av utfordringar og mulegheiter som fortida vår.


;There’s no guarantee that the Internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe.
Det finst ingen garantiar for at internett vil bli verande ope triveleg og trygt.


;Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people to make their voices heard and to shape their own online lives.

;Of course, we’re not alone in doing this.
Sjølvsagt er vi ikkje åleine om å gjere dette.


;The Mozilla community, together with other open source projects and other public benefit organizations, exists only because of the people who are engaged in making our common goals a reality.
