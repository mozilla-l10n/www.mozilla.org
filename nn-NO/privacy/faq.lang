# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
Det kan vere vanskeleg å vite kva ein kan vente seg av programvare og tenester no for tida. Dagens teknologi er kompleks, og dei færraste har tid til å setje seg inn i detaljane. Det gjeld òg for Firefox, der vi ser, at brukarane har mange ulike idear om kva som skjer under panseret i nettlesarane deira.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
Vi følgjer eit sett av <a href="%(link)s">datavernprinsipp</a> som for tilnærminga vår til personvern i Firefox for datamaskiner og mobile einingar.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
Vi samlar berre inn informasjon vi treng for å kunne lage dei beste produkta.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
Vi gir brukarane kontroll over sine data og opplevingar på nettet.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
Vi følgjer prinsippet om «ingen overraskingar», det vil seie at vi jobbar hardt for å sikre at brukarane våre kan forstå korleis Firefox samsvarer med røyndommen.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
Følgjande spørsmål og svar skal hjelpe deg med å forstå kva du kan vente deg frå Mozilla og Firefox:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Eg brukar Firefox til nesten alt på nettet. Folk hos Mozilla må vite ein heil del om meg, eller kva?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, nettlesaren som køyrer på eininga eller datamaskina di, er inngangen din til nettet. Nettlesaren din handterer mykje informasjon om nettstadane du besøkjer, men den informasjonen er att på eininga di. Mozilla, selskapet som lagar Firefox, samlar ikkje inn denne informasjonen (med mindre du ber oss om det).


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
Verkeleg, lagrar dei ikkje historikken min?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
Det verkar som alle selskap på nettet kjøper og sel informasjonen min. De er sannsynlegvis ikkje annleis.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
Mozilla sel ikkje data om deg, og vi kjøper ikkje data om deg.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
Vent lit, så korleis tenar de pengar då?

# "Softballs" here means questions requiring only easy or simple answers.
;Okay, those first few were softballs. What data do you collect?
Ok, det var dei enkle spørsmåla. Kva for opplysningar samlar de inn?

;Mozilla does collect a limited set of data by default from Firefox that helps us to understand how people use the browser. That data is tied to a random identifier, rather than your name or email address. You can read more about that on our <a href="%(privacy)s">privacy notice</a> and you can read the <a href="%(data)s">full documentation for that data collection</a>.

# "Gobbledygook" is a fun way to say nonsense or gibberish
;That documentation is gobbledygook to me! Can you give it to me in plain English?
Den dokumentasjonen er ikkje særleg lett å forstå. Kan du seie det til meg på vanleg norsk?


;There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of Firefox.
Det finst to kategoriar av data som vi samlar inn som standard i den ferdige versjonen av Firefox.


;The first is what we call "technical data." This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes.
Det første er det vi kallar «teknisk informasjon». Det er informasjon om nettlesaren, som til dømes operativsystemet han køyrer på og informasjon om feil eller krasj.


;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;Do you collect more data in pre-release versions of Firefox?
Samlar de inn fleire data i dei tidlege test-utgåvene av Firefox?


;Sort-of. In addition to the data described above, we receive crash and error reports by default in pre-release version of Firefox.
På ein måte. Utover dei data som er skildra ovanfor, samlar vi som standard inn rapporter om krasj- og feilsøking i førehandsversjonane av Firefox.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.

;But why do you collect any data at all?
Men kvifor samlar de inn data då?


;If we don’t know how the browser is performing or which features people use, we can’t make it better and deliver the great product you want. We’ve invested in building data collection and analysis tools that allow us to make smart decisions about our product while respecting people's privacy.

;Data collection still bugs me. Can I turn it off?
Eg bryr meg ikkje om dataindsamlinga. Kan eg slå henne av?

;What about my account data?
Kva med kontodataa mine?


;We are big believers of data minimization and not asking for things we don't need.
Vi trur på minimering av data, og spør ikkje etter noko vi ikkje treng.


;You don't need an account to use Firefox. <a href="%(accounts)s">Accounts</a> are required to sync data across devices, but we only ask you for an email address. We don't want to know things like your name, address, birthday and phone number.
Du treng ikkje ein konto for å bruke Firefox. <a href="%(accounts)s">Ein konto</a> er påkravd for å synkronisere informasjon på tvers av einingar, men vi ber berre om e-postadressa di. Namn, adresse, fødselsdag eller telefonnummer spør vi ikkje om.

;You use digital advertising as part of your marketing mix. Do you buy people's data to better target your online ads?
De brukar digital annonsering som ein del av marknadsføringa dykkar. Kjøper de folk sine data for å betre målrette annonsane dykkar på nettet?


;No, we do not buy people's data to target advertising.
Nei, vi kjøper ikkje folk sine data for målretta annonsar.


;We do ask our advertising partners to use only first party data that websites and publishers know about all users, such as the browser you are using and the device you are on.

;Well, it seems like you really have my back on this privacy stuff.
Hm, det ser ut til at vi verkeleg tek desse tinga alvorleg.


;Yes, we do.
Ja, det gjer vi.
