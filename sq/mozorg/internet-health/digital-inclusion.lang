Digital Inclusion: Vital to Internet Health

Digital inclusion means promoting diversity, practicing respect, and supporting universal access online.


;A Healthy Internet is Inclusive to All
Një Internet i Shëndetshëm është Përfshirës ndaj Kujtdo


;The more voices, perspective, languages, and people contributing to the Web, the richer the experience for everyone. But the whole Internet is not yet accessible, welcoming, and safe for all. Together, we have the power to shape the Web, and our world along with it.
Sa më shumë zëra, këndvështrime, gjuhë dhe njerëz që kontribuojnë në Web, aq më e pasur përvoja e secilit. Por i gjithë Interneti ende s’është i përdorshëm, mikpritës dhe i parrezik për këdo. Tok, e kemi fuqinë t’i japim formë Web-it, dhe tok me të edhe botës.


;A healthy Internet is open to you.
Një Internet i shëndetshëm është i hapur ndaj jush.


;Here are three areas where we can make a difference.
Ja tre fusha ku mund të bëjmë diçka.

;Digital Inclusion means promoting diversity
Përfshirja Dixhitale do të thotë të promovosh larminë


;For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise, it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people, everywhere.
Që Interneti të plotësojë premtimin e vet më të madh, ai duhet të pasqyrojë larminë dhe përvojën e krejt njerëzve, kudo.


;As inclusive as the Web can seem, it’s not yet an equal playing field. More than half the world is still without it; emerging economies and marginalized communities are often the last to gain access. Far fewer women are using the Internet than men. And without diversity among its creators, the Web itself will reflect unconscious biases, while personalizing algorithms can reinforce our own.
Edhe pse Web-i mund të duket si përfshirës, ende nuk fushë loje njësoj për të gjithë. Më shumë se gjysma e botës është ende pa të; ekonomi të saposhfaqura dhe bashkësi të lëna mënjanë shpesh janë të fundit në përdorimin e tij. Internetin e përdorin shumë më pak gra, sesa burra. Dhe pa larmi mes atyre që kontribuojnë, vetë Web-i do të pasqyrojë padashur njëanësi, teksa personalizimi i algoritmeve mund të ripërforcojë njëanësinë tonë.


;In nine developing countries, women are still nearly 50% less likely to access the Internet than men.
Në nëntë vende në zhvillim, femrat ende kanë thuajse 50% më pak gjasa të përdorin Internetin se sa meshkujt.

;How you can promote diversity
Si mund të promovoni larminë


;Create web content
Duke krijuar lëndë web


;Create your own Web content – like videos, blog posts, GIFs – in your language, local to your area.
Krijoni lëndën tuaj Web – të tilla si video, postime blogu, GIF-e – në gjuhën tuaj, që i përshtatet zonës tuaj.


;Build resources
Krijoni burime


;Support a resource like <a href="%(wiki_support)s">Wikipedia</a> that drastically lowers the barriers to knowledge – or better yet, <a href="%(wiki_contribute)s">help build it</a>. Wikipedia needs more, and more diverse, contributors.
Përkrahni një burim të tillë si <a href="%(wiki_support)s">Wikipedia</a>, që i ul në mënyrë drastike pengesat ndaj dijes – ose akoma më mirë, <a href="%(wiki_contribute)s">ndihmoni në krijimin e saj</a>. Wikipedia ka nevojë për më shumë kontribues, dhe më të larmishëm.

;We’ve all seen our share of nasty comments sections. At times, the Web can feel like a very unfriendly place – particularly for women, minorities, and members of marginalized communities. By discouraging people from getting online, cyberbullying and cyber violence threaten not just individuals, but the Internet itself.

;To participate online, you have to be able to get online. Programs have emerged that offer free or subsidized Internet access, but it is often slow or restricted, creating a ‘poor Internet for poor people.’ At its most extreme, governments worldwide are turning off all or parts of the Internet to serve their own agendas, which can threaten human rights and even the health of the global economy.
