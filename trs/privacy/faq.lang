# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.

;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.

;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
Dunâj ñûnj riña nej guìi da' dugumîn man'an ni si nuguàn' ni nī sa ahuin chrūn ni riña lînia.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
Nikò' ñûnj nuguan' “Nitāj si diga'ñu'ūnj un”, nī gata ruhuaj sisī 'iaj sun ñûnj da' gā hue'ê Firefox da' da' gui.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:

;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Maninānj Firefox arâj sunj riña Web. Nej et, sa nikāj dugui' ngà Mozilla, ûta ni'iint rayi'î si guruhuaj, sê danj ân'.


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, Nabegadôr nū riña nej si agâ't, huej huin rahue'e da' gatūt riña Web. Nù yikïn nabegadôr nan narikij daran' nuguan' huā rayi'î nej sitiô atûjt, nuguan' dan nī natûj man'an riña si agâ't.

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
