;Introduction
引言


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
互联网作为人们生活的一部分，其重要性日益增加。


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Mozilla是一个全球化的社区。社区成员们坚信开放，创新，和机遇是互联网持续健康发展的关键因素。作为一个社区，我们从1998年开始为确保互联网的发展造福所有用户而共同努力。我们因创作Mozilla Firefox网络浏览器而广为人知。


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Mozilla基于社区创建世界一流的开放源代码软件，并且开拓各种新式的合作活动。我们志同道合，致力于改善广大互联网用户的上网体验。


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
通过共同努力，我们总结出一系列准则并相信它们是保证公共利益和商业活动能够受益于互联网的决定性因素。我们在以下列出这些准则。


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
此宣言的目的是


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
清晰的展示Mozilla参与者期望Mozilla基金会追求的互联网未来的发展前景；


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
与无论是否具有技术背景的群体沟通；


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
让Mozilla 贡献者对于我们所做的感到自豪，并激励我们继续努力；同时


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
为他人提供一个框架以便推动互联网的发展前景.


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
这些准则需要大家的共同努力得以实现。互联网的开放和参与需要大家的个人贡献，团队协作，和发挥领导作用。Mozilla基金会承诺推行Mozilla宣言里制定的准则。我们邀请更多的同仁加入我们，共同奋斗使互联网变得更好。


;Principles

;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
推行Mozilla宣言


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
推行Mozilla宣言里的准则有多种途径。我们欢迎广泛的活动并期待参与者发挥像在Mozilla其他项目中那样的创造性。对于尚未深入参与 Mozilla项目的个人，支持宣言的最简单而有效的办法就是使用Mozilla Firefox以及其他体现Mozilla宣言准则的产品。
