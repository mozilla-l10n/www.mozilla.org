;How to stop seeing too many ads and keep companies from following you around online. An ad blocker guide from the Firefox web browser.
來自 Firefox 網頁瀏覽器的廣告封鎖指南，教您如何減少看到廣告的數量，並且防止各個公司在網路上追蹤您。


;The ad blocker – a secret weapon against annoying ads.
廣告封鎖器 - 對討人厭的廣告的秘密武器。


;So many ads, so little patience… It’s time to stop the madness.
廣告太多了，我才沒有那個閒工夫…是時候該封鎖掉這些廣告了。


;The average person sees an average of 4,000 ads a day. If you think that’s too many, an ad blocker is your new best friend.
一般人平均一天會看到 4,000 組廣告。如果您覺得這數字太多了，廣告封鎖器就會是您的好朋友。


;An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.
廣告封鎖器就是一套用來封鎖廣告用的軟體，可以用兩種方式運作。第一種是直接封鎖來自廣告商伺服器的流量，這樣流量就不會在您開啟的頁面中出現。另一種方式是封鎖網頁中，可能是廣告的內容。


;These ads might be loud video ads, ads that follow you around the web, trackers, third-party cookies, and more. To use an ad blocker, you can search for ad blocker add-ons that are available in your browser. <a href="%(firefox)s">Firefox</a>, for example, has <a href="%(addons)s">this list of approved ad blocker add-ons</a>. Click on this list (or ad blockers that are approved for your browser) and see which fits your needs.
這些廣告可能是吵雜的影片廣告，並且會以追蹤器、第三方 Cookie 等型態會在網路上的各個角落追蹤你。若要使用廣告封鎖器，可以直接搜尋您的瀏覽器所適用的附加元件。舉例來說，<a href="%(firefox)s">Firefox</a> 就有<a href="%(addons)s">這些經過審核的廣告封鎖附加元件</a>。可以看看此清單中有哪套符合您的需求。

尋找最合適您的廣告封鎖器


;There’s <a href="%(url)s">AdBlocker Ultimate</a> that gets rid of every single ad, but buyer beware. Some of your favorite newspapers and magazines rely on advertising. Too many people blocking their ads could put them out of business.

;Popup ads are the worst. Block them with <a href="%(url)s">Popup Blocker</a> and never deal with another annoying popup again.
彈出式廣告是最糟的。可以使用<a href="%(url)s">彈出式廣告封鎖器</a>來阻擋，這樣就再也不會看到討人厭的視窗跳出來了。

;Create a tracker-free zone with Content Blocking
使用內容封鎖功能，建立無追蹤器的區域


;On Firefox, you can use <a href="%(privacy)s">Privacy</a> or <a href="%(blocking)s">Content Blocking</a> settings to get even more control over ad trackers that serve you the ads.

請點擊畫面右上角的 Firefox 選單按鈕。看起來像是三條平行線組合而成的漢堡選單。然後在下拉選單中點擊「內容封鎖」。您應該會看到有幾個選項的藍色視窗。


;Go easy with Standard mode
使用簡單輕鬆的標準模式


;If ads don’t bother you and you don’t mind being followed by trackers and third-party cookies, then the Standard setting should work for you. To get trackers off your tail in Standard mode, use a <a href="%(url)s">Private Browsing</a> window.
如果廣告不太影響您，您也不介意被追蹤器或第三方 Cookie 追蹤，標準設定應該就夠用了。在標準模式中若想讓追蹤器找不到您，請使用<a href="%(url)s">隱私瀏覽視窗</a>。
