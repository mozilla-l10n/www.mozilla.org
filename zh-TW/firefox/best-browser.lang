;Find your best browser for speed, privacy and security.
尋找對您來說，隱私權、速度、安全性表現最棒的瀏覽器。


# HTML page description
;So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
市場上有五花八門的瀏覽器可供選擇，但只有一套瀏覽器最適合您。最好的瀏覽器應該上網速度超快，又能保護您的隱私。


;Privacy, speed, and security.
隱私權、速度、安全性。


;How to choose the best browser for you.
如何選擇對您來說最棒的瀏覽器。


;The internet has become as essential as electricity and running water, so choosing the best browser for you is more important than ever. The internet is a second office, a teacher and sometimes a medical advisor, even if your actual doctor would prefer you didn’t look up your symptoms online.
網際網路已經變得跟水、電一樣重要，所以挑選最佳的瀏覽器也比以往變得更重要。網際網路就像是第二個辦公室、一位老師，甚至是醫療顧問。就算醫生有時候可能會希望您沒有先在網路上找過與您的症狀的相關資訊。


;In the mid-nineties, Netscape, Internet Explorer and AOL dominated the landscape. It was a simpler time when the sweet melody of dial-up internet rang across the land. You learned the meaning of patience waiting for web pages to load. Back then, all that mattered was browser speed.
1990 年代中期，Netscape、Internet Explorer 與 AOL 稱霸了整個市場。在大家還需要使用數據機撥號上網時，事情還很單純。你學會了要保持耐心，等待網頁載入。當時，最重要的事情是瀏覽器的速度。


;Today is a different story. Ads, privacy hacks, security breaches, and fake news might have you looking at other qualities in a browser. How does the browser protect your privacy? Does it allow trackers to follow you across the web? Does it built to multitask and handle many computer and internet operations at once?
現在是完全另一碼事。您上網時可能會遇到許多廣告、隱私權駭客、安全漏洞、假新聞。瀏覽器如何保護您的隱私？會不會允許追蹤器在網路上追蹤您？是否可以多工操作，一次處理好幾件事？


;When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
當您用瀏覽器來做各種事情時效能就相當重要。也因為相同原因，應該要確保隱私。瀏覽器經手了您在線上做的任何事情，如果隱私保護功能不夠強大，可能就會讓您身處危險之中。

;If you’re wondering what it means to have a private or fast browser, here’s a breakdown of three things a browser should have.
如果您想知道瀏覽器要做到哪些事才能兼顧速度與隱私保護，以下是瀏覽器應該具備的三件事。


;A browser built for speed.
為了速度而打造的瀏覽器。


;A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.

;This is one of the many reasons to choose the Firefox browser: Firefox blocks third-party trackers by default. We have other reasons and we’ll get into those later.

;A browser that puts safety first.
安全第一的瀏覽器。


;Remember the last massive data breach? If not, it’s probably because it happens so often. Companies hold on to customer data, like their personal or financial information, and hackers steal it. If you’re making safety a priority, then a secure internet browser is the best browser for you.
記得上次發生的大規模資料外洩事件是什麼嗎？如果已經不記得了，大概是太常發生了。有大大小小的公司會收集各種客戶資料，當中包含個人或財務相關資訊，是駭客喜愛竊取的資料。若您將安全性設為第一目標，安全的瀏覽器對您就是最重要的。


;There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.
瀏覽器有許多方式能夠確保使用者的安全。使用最新安全技術的瀏覽器，可協助您的電腦與網站不受惡意軟體與電腦病毒的騷擾。


;The second is not storing too much user data. Hackers can’t steal what’s not there, which is why Firefox keeps a minimum amount of information about its users. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox knows</a> if you use the browser and your general location <a href="%(privacy)s">but not the name of your childhood pet or your favorite color.</a>

;Last but not least, a safe browser should offer tools to help you keep an eye on your accounts. Think of alerts that go straight to your email if any of your accounts get breached or icons that tell you whether a website is encrypted, (i.e., if it’s a good idea to enter your credit number on a shopping site).

;Firefox is offering something new to keep you safe: <a href="%(monitor)s">Firefox Monitor</a>. It’s a free service that will alert you if there are any public hacks on your accounts and let you know if your accounts got hacked in the past. Another neat feature is the Green Lock. It looks like a small green icon at the top left side of the browser window. If you’re on Firefox and see the green lock, it means the website is encrypted and secure. If the lock is grey, you might want to think twice about entering any sensitive information.

;We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.
我們每天都會造訪數以百計甚至千計的網站，您無法預期使用者能對每個網站都做出正確的決定，來確保他們的安全性與隱私權。這也就是為什麼能讓您自行控制的瀏覽器非常重要: 這代表實際而有意義的保護。


;A browser that minds its business.
不管閒事的瀏覽器。


;Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

;Trackers are all those annoying “cookies” messages you get on airline sites. These third-party trackers know where you click and can be used to analyze your behavior. A private browser should give users the option to turn off third-party trackers, but ideally, turn them off by default.

;Another way to stop trackers from tracking is using private mode to browse. Any browser that claims to be private should offer browsing in private mode.
另一個能夠防止追蹤器追蹤的方式是使用隱私瀏覽模式上網。任何宣稱保護使用者隱私的瀏覽器，都應該提供隱私瀏覽模式。


;One easy way to check is to visit a browser’s content setting page and privacy policy. The privacy webpage should outline if your data is shared and why. It’s why the <a href="%(privacy)s">Firefox privacy notice</a> is easy to read and easy to find.
