;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Firefox 中的重要變更: 獨立設定檔


;What’s Changed
有什麼異動？


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
在此之前，同一台裝置上安裝的所有 Firefox 預設都共享同一組設定檔。現在 Firefox 會為不同的安裝（包含 Firefox Nightly、Beta、ESR）建立不同的設定檔。如此一來，在同一台電腦上切換不同版本時，運作可更為穩定。


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
獨立設定檔的工作原理


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox 會將書籤、密碼、偏好設定等資訊儲存在叫做「設定檔」的一系列檔案中。設定檔會與 Firefox 程式檔案儲存於不同地方。


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.

;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.

;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
